# OmniFocus Scripts

## Scripts

### Birthdays

 The script adds a task to your OmniFocus Inbox for each contact with a nearby birthday. The number of days to look ahead can be set in the script.

 You could run the script as part of your weekly review.

## Script locations

There are 2 logical locations to save your scripts

1. The Application Scripts folder
2. The Scripts/Applications folder

Any script in the Application Scripts folder (`/Users/username/Library/Application Scripts/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus3`) can be run from within OmniFocus, and can be added to the task bar.

Any script in the Applications folder (`/Users/username/Library/Scripts/Applications/OmniFocus`) can be run from the standard MacOS Scripts menu.
